!!!!  PLEASE READ THESE NOTES PRIOR TO CONTINUING WITH YOUR BUILD !!!!

A)  This assembly comes in relatively close conditions to a heated bed and stepper motor. I will not support issues due to using materials such as 
PLA to build the assembly. PLA and similar materials are NOT suitable to build 3D printer parts out of, please do not ask if PLA is ok, it is not. If you 
are going to use PETG for the build, please keep an eye on the motor mount area and consider reducing current to your motor. Steppers produce heat and 
PETG (while better than PLA) still has a lower TG point, it could warp.

B)  THIS IS A BETA RELEASE AND NOT THE FINAL PRODUCT, YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR SAFETY AND EQUIPMENT WHEN BUILDING AND USING THIS SYSTEM AND 
YOU ACCEPT ALL LIABILITY BY USING THESE FILES FROM THIS BETA TO RELEASE CANDIDATES AND POST!

# PREFACE

This is the first rendition of the Alchemy_Mini_Bowden.   This system's initial design is based on the Voron Jetpack motion components.  During discusions 
the main VORON discord in the Jetpack support area, it became apparent the system was not popular as it did not achieve shortening the bowden as well as
the developers intended.  This being paired with the popularity of the Afterburner and Stealthburner toolheads kinda left the Jetpack in a hard place. 

The goal of this project is to remedy its failings and povide an ultra lightweight but powerful extruder to ride the X gantry, also being able to rotate allowing the shortest bowden tube possible.  The rotation removes the need for additional large bending radius turns to get to the hotend by providing a direct route, while also being mounted in the closest possible position to all locations the toolhead moves on gantry. In the initial testing of this unit, it was able to achieve a Bowden length approximately 10", considering the stock tube is near 20" long, thats an improvement of basically 50%.  This is where we can say the project has been able to carry the Jetpacks original concept across the finish line.

Much has changed in this system from its inspirational original product at the Voron project, simply put... everything changed and it really is not the 
same unit.   However I would like to extend a special thanks to the Voron group for their inspiration on this product.  Please take a moment if you are not familiar with the Voron project to educate yourself on the hard work they commit to the makerspace.  https://vorondesign.com/

Once this product leaves beta, along with the additional variations, scheduled is an entire 3D printer based on the principles these units bring.

Highly Recommended Items Below

10. QTY - 1 - Threadlocker (Loctite Blue or similar strength, its important to note that threadlockers WILL damage ASA/ABS if they come in contact, take care when applying thread lockers that it only gets on the metal assembly.)
